# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running. Hint: It's a Rails app. Do the normal Rails-y stuff.

Machines, yo.

Something like 14 years ago I started on this thing called a "site engine" which was
basically a glorified content management system with a bunch of plugins for
things like theming, forums, chat, journals, whatever.

It was called Maquinas.

Google Translate tells me that's Spanish for Machines.

What a stupid fucking name.

This is a git-based project. You're probably reading this on GitHub, so that's probably obvious.

The master branch contains a base to start from.

Other branches turn that base into things that might be useful.

Useful as code samples I can show recruiters and engineering managers, if nothing else.

Narcissism: It keeps you not-dead.
